- How to utilize platform events to interact with embedded components via code

#### Bonus: ThoughtSpot Everywhere APIs and TML

- Using Postman to manage API collections with ThoughtSpot

### What you need:
- No local environment configuration is required. Everything can be completed via a browser on any computer or tablet. Google Chrome is recommended.
